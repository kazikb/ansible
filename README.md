# ansible

This repository contains my Ansible playbooks and roles that i wrote to better known this awesome tool.

Roles have separated README file with description what this role configures, lists of variables and example playbooks.

Playbooks have detailed comments at the beginning of the file witch explained what is its purpose.

In my lab environment i use Debian/Ubuntu/CentOS/Rocky Linux and most of the code in this repo should run on those distribution. In case of roles i put info about suported platforms in theire meta file.

If suport for Debian OS family is not needed in a playbook then i defently recommend to check awesome [Linux System Roles](https://linux-system-roles.github.io/) if component that need to be configured isnt alredy included there.
